Getting the entire team together is always great. Getting the team together for a hackathon under the pine trees and next to the sea in lovely Chalkida is just perfect. The theme of the 48-hour hackathon was "Growth Hacking" and featured over 40 brilliant ideas, 4 of which became a reality, wood smoked boston butt, team-made pizzas, drones and just the right balance of coffee and beer.
